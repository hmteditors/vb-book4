## Transcription

ἐδη μη γόρουν: ἐκ τοῦ ἀγορὴ ἀγορῶ: ἠγορωντο: καὶ διαιρέσει ἢ μᾶλλον πλεονασμῷ, ἠγορόῶντο

---

## Translation

This word means coming together; this come from “ἀγορὴ” which gives the verb ἀγορῶ and ἡγορωντο and this is diaeresis or rather by pleonasm 

---

## Diairesis and Pleonasm

- διαιρέσει is about division, and, in this case, a resolution of a diphthong into two syllables

- 	πλεονασμῷ means overabundance, and, in this case, the use of redundant syllables

---

## Interpretation

- The word ἠγορόωμτο has an extra syllable in it (it should be ἡγορωντο, as the scholion points out)

- Homer includes the extra syllable either through a combination of two syllables or through a superfluous redundancy

---

## This is a cool scholion

- Because it follows the linguistical path in an attempt to explain how a Homeric form differs from the norm

- ἀγορὴ -> ἀγορῶ (contract verb) -> ἡγορωντο (the imperfect 3rd plural form). How does ἡγορωντο become ἠγορόωμτο? The author believes that it was by separation or superfluous redundancy
